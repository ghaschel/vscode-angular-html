## My Highlighting is not working as in previous versions.

This extension was written a long time ago, when I didn't know much of what I was doing with TextMate Grammars, so I wrote it just to get some light in my undistinguable-from-html Angular templates. But that caused it to only work greatly with a few themes, and thus, not being everyone's cup of tea. So in order to be able to make it customizable, I have added a Settings session, in which you can change all of your extra-matched characters colors so that it fits exactly to your taste. Please, bear in mind that this will not theme-specific. If you change a theme, you might need to edit again. That said, there is a alternative for those who just want to get the legacy colors customizations back on. You can run the `vscode-angular-html: Set legacy colors customizations` command in the command pallete, and it will work just as before. For the list of supported themes for the legacy colors customization, refer to [supported themes](SUPPORTED-THEMES.md).

## How can I request a new theme, or a change to an already supported theme?
